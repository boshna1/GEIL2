Turret Dodger

The types of objects my factories can create are different variant turrets and their respective bullets

I think the factory pattern is a good choice for spawning these objects because in my gameloop, its dodging all different kinds of turret bullets with varying properties. Since there are multiple types, the factory can have a default setting turret and have modularity for any new turret, and by proxy have different bullets aswell. This also gives the possibility of interchanging turrets and bullets, for example a high fire rate turret with low velocity bullets can be swapped for high fire rate turret with high velocity bullets.
